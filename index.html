                <p>The night before cooking, salt the chicken inside and out. Wrap the chicken in kitchen paper and put in the fridge.

                    Remove from the fridge and leave to come to room temperature.
                    
                    When stuffing the bird, leave an air gap between the stuffing and the top of the breast bone.
                    
                    Cut the wing tips from the chicken to make a trivet, this will help to stop the chicken burning.
                    
                    Weigh the chicken.
                    
                    To make the chicken juicy and golden, rub butter all over it and sprinkle over a little lemon juice.
                    
                    Cook at 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 for the first 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Cook the chicken for 40 minutes per kilo or until cooked through.
                    
                    Rest the chicken for 30 minutes.</p>

                    <p>Roasting is a dry-heat cooking technique that uses either high temperature or a combination of high and low. The high temperature is what gives the beef its mouth-watering, crispy, brown exterior, while the low temperature is what cooks it to its proper doneness.

                        For smaller roasts, you might only need a short burst of high heat to reach perfect medium-rare. For a larger roast, you would do most of the cooking at a low temperature and then sear it in a very hot oven, either at the beginning or very end of cooking.
                        
                        Because beef cooks quickly at a high temperature, there's little opportunity to break down connective tissues. Therefore, the best cuts of beef for roasting are the tender ones.</p></div>

                    <p>Prep: Snip off tough outer leaves; cut off top quarter and trim off woody stem.
                        
                        Braise: Heat 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet; add baby artichokes and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 1 cup each white wine (or dry vermouth) and water and 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or rosemary or tarragon). Bring to a simmer; cover, reduce heat and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
                        
                        Grill: Halve artichokes, scoop out the choke if necessary, then toss with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Preheat grill. Place the artichokes over direct, medium-high heat and cook, turning once or twice, until tender, about 8 minutes.
